Personal Color Palette Generator.

Generate and save your favourite palettes. 

If you have a specific color scheme in mind, you can select your desired colors and lock it. The position of locked colors does influence the generated palette so experiment with different positions.

If you have two complimentary colors, try placing them at each end. Contrasting colors placed closer together will generate a more triadic color scheme.

The generator utilises the Colormind API. For more info visit Colormind.io.
